- 👋 Hi, this is the @tryadvocacy GitHub repository.
- 👀 Try Advocacy, a Not-for-Profit-Organization. We Integrate People.
- 🌱 We're currently learning about environment sensors like the BME280, using Python and a well-aged raspberry pi 400.
- 💞️ We're basically about getting veterans, returning expats, and people returning from abroad back into the workforce.
- 📫 Find more information on Twitter (now called X) at @advocacyorg. We're sometimes prototyping WordPress ideas on InstaWP.
